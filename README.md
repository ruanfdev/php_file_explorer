# PHP File Explorer

### A file explorer for a server running PHP:
* Place both files `fb.php` and `file.php` in the desired directory
* Navigate to `(YOUR_DIRECTORY/fb.php, e.g. https://example.com/fb.php)` to use the explorer
* Clicking on a folder will open the folder and clicking on a file will download the file

### Note:
* You can rename `fb.php` to anything you like, just make sure to keep the `.php` file extension
* Renaming `file.php` is also possible, you'll just have to make sure to rename the `file.php` instance in `fb.php`
